2. Export Code Signing Identity certificates.
   1. Open up Keychain Access
   2. Make sure you are under `Login` -> `My Certificates`
   3. Right click on the certificate (Let's say your distribution cert.) -> Export -> choose `.cer` as file format -> save as `dist.cer`
   4. Expand the same certificate. You should see a private key entry. Export it like the previous step but choose `.p12` as file format. Save as `dist.p12`. You will prompted for a password. Generate one and it will be your `KEY_PASSWORD`.
